# Introduction
Welcome to the API documentation for [{{URL}}]({{URL}}).

Questions, comments, concerns, complaints? [Join us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/6GEHHQh)

## Accessing the API
The API can be accessed using the base URL `{{URL}}/{locale}`, where `{locale}` is an
[ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) language code. For example, to access the API in English, you would
use the base URL `{{URL}}/en`.

Note that only the values of certain text fields are localized, not the field names themselves. Additionally, certain
enumerated values (such as [weapon type](#weaponkind)) are not localized.

Some fields may not have localized values for every language. If a field has not been localized for your specified
language, the value will be `null` instead.

### Controlling Response Fields
All endpoints support a `p` query parameter that can be used to control which fields are included in the response
from the API. Read the [Projecting Results](#projecting-results) section for more information.

### Filtering Objects in the Response
All list endpoints support a `q` query parameter that can be used to filter items in the response from the API. A
"list endpoint" is usually a `GET` request to the top-level path hierarchy, e.g. `GET /items`, but endpoints that
support filtering will indicate that they fall into this category. Read the [Searching the API](#searching-the-api)
section for more information.

Such endpoints also support two additional query parameters, `limit` and `offset`, which can be used to paginate
results from the API. The `limit` parameter indicates that maximum number of elements that should be included in the
response, and `offset` is a zero-based index to begin including results from. For example:

`GET {{URL}}/en/items?limit=10&offset=0`

This would return 10 [Items](#items) from the API, beginning at the first element. To move to the second page, you can
simply increase `offset` by the number of elements in each page, like so:

`GET {{URL}}/en/items?limit=10&offset=10`

## Reading this document
All example URLs use the `en` locale (e.g. "{{URL}}/**en**/items"), but your application can use any valid language code.

Some examples have their properties truncated to save space. Any time you see "[...]", this indicates that the example
has been truncated, but there would normally be much more data present in the response.
